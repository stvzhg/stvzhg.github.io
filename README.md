# Mind Palace: knowledge vault backed by Obsidan and Jekyll Garden
A fork of [Jekyll Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io)

Jekyll Garden theme lets you publish your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault (or a subset of it) as a Jekyll static website. The theme is markdown and Obsidian setup friendly. You can use your own server or Github page to set up your SSG. Check out the demo.
